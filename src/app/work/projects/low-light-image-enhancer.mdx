## Overview

The Low-Light Image Enhancer is a web application that leverages deep learning to automatically enhance images captured in low-light conditions. Built with a Flask backend serving a PyTorch-based MIRNet model and a responsive React frontend, this project demonstrates end-to-end AI model deployment.

## Problem & Solution

Low-light photography often results in images with poor visibility, noise, and color distortion. This application provides an easy-to-use interface where users can upload low-light images and receive enhanced versions with improved brightness, contrast, and detail preservation.

## Technical Architecture

### Backend (Flask API)

```python
# Flask endpoint serving MIRNet model
@app.route('/enhance', methods=['POST'])
def enhance_image():
    image = request.files['image']
    enhanced = mirnet_model.predict(image)
    return send_enhanced_image(enhanced)
```

- **Model**: Pre-trained MIRNet (Multi-scale Illumination Refinement Network)
- **Framework**: PyTorch for model inference
- **API**: RESTful Flask API with image upload/download endpoints
- **Preprocessing**: Image normalization and tensor conversion
- **Postprocessing**: Denormalization and format conversion

### Frontend (React)

- **File Upload**: Drag-and-drop interface for image uploads
- **Image Preview**: Before/after comparison view
- **Processing Status**: Loading indicators and progress feedback
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface
- **API Integration**: Axios for HTTP requests to Flask backend

## Implementation Journey

### Initial Attempt: Zero-DCE

Initially attempted to implement Zero-DCE (Zero-Reference Deep Curve Estimation), a lightweight model for low-light enhancement. After several implementation challenges including:

- Model convergence issues
- Integration complexities
- Performance bottlenecks

Decided to pivot to a more robust solution.

### Final Solution: MIRNet

Transitioned to MIRNet, which provided:

- Better out-of-the-box performance with pre-trained weights
- Stable inference pipeline
- Superior enhancement quality
- Easier integration with Flask

## Key Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple drag-and-drop image upload
- **Real-time Processing**: Fast inference with optimized model
- **Image Comparison**: Side-by-side view of original and enhanced images
- **Download Capability**: Export enhanced images
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, Axios, CSS3
- **Backend**: Flask, Python
- **Deep Learning**: PyTorch, MIRNet
- **Image Processing**: PIL (Python Imaging Library), NumPy
- **Deployment**: Local development environment

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

1. **Model Loading Time**:
   - Problem: Model initialization caused slow first request
   - Solution: Implemented model preloading on server startup

2. **Image Format Handling**:
   - Problem: Various input formats (JPEG, PNG, HEIC)
   - Solution: Added format detection and conversion

3. **Memory Management**:
   - Problem: Large images causing memory issues
   - Solution: Implemented image resizing and batch processing

4. **CORS Issues**:
   - Problem: Cross-origin requests blocked
   - Solution: Configured Flask-CORS properly

## Learnings

- **Model Deployment**: Practical experience deploying PyTorch models in production
- **Full-Stack Integration**: Connecting React frontend with Flask backend
- **Error Handling**: Implementing robust error handling for file uploads and processing
- **Adaptability**: Pivoting from Zero-DCE to MIRNet based on practical constraints
- **Performance Optimization**: Balancing model quality with inference speed

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for video enhancement
- Implement batch processing for multiple images
- Add adjustable enhancement parameters
- Deploy to cloud platform (AWS/Vercel + Flask on Render)
- Implement user authentication and history
