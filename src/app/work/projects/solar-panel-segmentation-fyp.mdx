## Overview

This Final Year Project tackles the challenge of automatically annotating and segmenting solar panels from satellite imagery using self-supervised learning techniques. The goal was to develop a robust computer vision system that could identify solar panel installations without requiring extensive labeled datasets.

## Problem Statement

Traditional supervised learning approaches for image segmentation require large amounts of labeled data, which is time-consuming and expensive to obtain. This project explores self-supervised learning methods to learn meaningful representations from unlabeled satellite imagery, which can then be fine-tuned for solar panel segmentation with minimal labeled data.

## Technical Approach

### Self-Supervised Learning Methods

**Initial Approach: MoCo v2**

- Implemented Momentum Contrast (MoCo) v2 for contrastive learning
- Trained on unlabeled satellite imagery to learn visual representations
- Experimented with different augmentation strategies and hyperparameters
- Encountered challenges with convergence and representation quality

**Current Approach: BYOL**

- Shifted to Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL) for improved stability
- BYOL eliminates the need for negative pairs, simplifying the training process
- Achieved significantly lower loss compared to MoCo v2
- Currently working to improve standard deviation metrics for better representation consistency

### Architecture

- **Backbone**: ResNet-50 encoder
- **SSL Framework**: BYOL with online and target networks
- **Segmentation Head**: U-Net style decoder for pixel-level predictions
- **Training Strategy**: Two-stage approach (SSL pretraining → supervised fine-tuning)

## Key Learnings

1. **Self-Supervised Learning**: Deep understanding of contrastive learning and its alternatives
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Importance of learning rate scheduling, momentum updates, and augmentation strategies
3. **Model Evaluation**: Analyzing loss curves, feature representations, and downstream task performance
4. **Research Methodology**: Iterating through approaches based on experimental results

## Technologies Used

- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework
- **BYOL & MoCo v2**: Self-supervised learning algorithms
- **CNNs**: Convolutional Neural Networks for feature extraction
- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Satellite Imagery**: High-resolution satellite images for training

## Challenges

- **MoCo v2 Performance**: Initial experiments with MoCo v2 showed unstable training and suboptimal representation learning
- **BYOL Fine-Tuning**: While achieving low loss, working to improve feature consistency (standard deviation)
- **Data Processing**: Handling large-scale satellite imagery and efficient data pipelines
- **Computational Resources**: Managing GPU resources for extended training runs

## Current Status

The project is in active development with BYOL showing promising results. The next steps include:

- Optimizing BYOL hyperparameters to improve feature diversity
- Implementing the segmentation head and fine-tuning pipeline
- Evaluating on labeled solar panel datasets
- Comparing results with fully supervised baselines

## Impact

This project demonstrates the practical application of cutting-edge self-supervised learning techniques to real-world computer vision problems. The approach can significantly reduce the annotation burden for satellite image analysis tasks and has potential applications in renewable energy monitoring and urban planning.
